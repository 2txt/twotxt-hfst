This folder contains source code for SWIG bindings for using HFST library with
Python. The bindings work with Python versions 2 and 3.


=====================
BUILDING THE BINDINGS
=====================

Building and installation is done using the standard Python module distutils.
Once you've successfully built HFST library (located in the parent directory,
if you are compiling from source), use the script setup.py to build the Python
extension eg. like so:

    python setup.py build_ext --inplace


The script setup.py links by default to HFST C++ library which is located in
folder "../libhfst/src/.libs/". If you have HFST installed and wish to use it
instead, modify 'extra_link_arguments' as commented in setup.py:

   extra_link_arguments = ["-Wl,-rpath=" + absolute_libhfst_src_path + "/.libs"]
   # If you wish to use an installed version of HFST C++ library instead, replace the above with:
   # extra_link_arguments = []


=================
RUNNING THE TESTS
=================

The folder 'test' contains tests for the bindings. See test/README for more
information.


=======================
INSTALLING THE BINDINGS
=======================

If you wish to install the extension, run

    python setup.py install


For further information, consult

    python setup.py --help
    python setup.py --help-commands

and the distutils documentation.


==================
USING THE BINDINGS
==================

The bindings should be usable after installation in Python with command:

  import hfst

NOTE: If you want to use Python bindings locally, either add the absolute path 
to this folder to PYTHONPATH, e.g. by executing

    PYTHONPATH="path/to/hfst-top-dir/python:"$PYTHONPATH

or do the following in Python before importing hfst:

    import sys
    sys.path.insert(1, 'path/to/hfst-top-dir/python')


====================
THE PYTHON INTERFACE
====================

C++ side functions and classes are wrapped with SWIG under module 'libhfst'. It
is possible to use this module directly, but there is a package named 'hfst'
which encapsulates the libhfst module in a more user-friendly manner. The
structure of the package is

 * hfst
    * hfst.exceptions
    * hfst.rules
    * hfst.types

The module hfst.exceptions contains HfstException and its subclasses and the
module hfst.rules functions that create transducers implementing two-level
rules. The module hfst.types contains transducer implementation types. All
other functions and classes are in module hfst.

For documentation and examples, see <https://hfst.github.io/python/index.html>.


==========
KNOWN BUGS
==========

Some version combinations of SWIG and Python make HFST exception classes
subclasses of Python's _object instead of Exception. Then you will get an
error like

    TypeError: catching classes that do not inherit from BaseException is not allowed

If this is the case, run

    sed -i 's/class HfstException(_object):/class HfstException(Exception):/' libhfst.py

after build/installation to be able to use HfstException and its subclasses in
Python.
