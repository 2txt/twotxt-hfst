    HFST Langname-analyze and Langname-generate installer

This package installs HFST's Langname-language morphological transducers and
scripts.

As root, "make install" installs system-wide scripts under /usr/local/bin and
transducers under /usr/local/share/hfst. "make uninstall" does the reverse.

After installation, the scripts
	LANGNAME-analyze
and
	LANGNAME-generate
will perform analysis and generation by attempting to run, respectively,
hfst-tokenize and hfst-lookup.
