So you have an analyzing morphological transducer and would like to make an
installable tool around it for analyzing running text, and generating wordforms
from morphological tags given by the user.

The main command for this is make-installable.sh. It expects to have the
morphology in the working directory under the name "langname.hfst", where
"langname" is the name of the language in question, eg. "french.hfst". Run it
like so:

./make-installable.sh french fr [-w | --weighted] [--capcase] [--punct]

fr is the language code
-w or --weighted controls whether the analyzer will be weighted
--capcase controls whether to compose in a casing handler
--punct controls whether to include a punctuation handler

For now it will also generate a separate tokenizer, effectively including three
copies of the morphology (one for analyzing, one for generating, one for
tokenizing). Hopefully this will be corrected in the future.

For best results, check the following things:

1) Does the morphology handle capital letters at the beginning of words? If not,
you should use --capcase

2) Does the morphology know about punctuation like .,!? If not, consider using
--punct
